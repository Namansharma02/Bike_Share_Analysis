    "Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. You will also see if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users."

    "## Posing Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before looking at the bike sharing data, you should start by asking questions you might want to understand about the bike share data. Consider, for example, if you were working for Motivate. What kinds of information would you want to know about in order to make smarter business decisions? If you were a user of the bike-share service, what factors might influence how you would want to use the service?\n",
    "Write at least two questions related to bike sharing that you think could be answered by data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my case ,First I will check if there is enough availability of bikes with respect to the users using it.\n",
    "            I will check if the company is giving offers or not, If I can afford it or not.\n",
    "            As a user I would ask if I can use the bike more than the time given.\n",
    "            Are there any extra charges except the bike ride. Is there any insurance cover."

    "Now it's time to collect and explore our data. In this project, we will focus on the record of individual trips taken in 2016 from our selected cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. Each of these cities has a page where we can freely download the trip data.:\n",
    "\n",
    "- New York City (Citi Bike): [Link](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)\n",
    "- Chicago (Divvy): [Link](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data)\n",
    "- Washington, DC (Capital Bikeshare): [Link](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you visit these pages, you will notice that each city has a different way of delivering its data. Chicago updates with new data twice a year, Washington DC is quarterly, and New York City is monthly. The data has already been collected and is stored in the rar file with this project. While the original data for 2016 is spread among multiple files for each city, the files in the folder collect all of the trip data for the year into one file per city.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is still a lot of data to investigate, so it's a good idea to start off by looking at one entry from each of the cities thats is going to be analyzed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the first code cell below to load some packages and functions that you'll be using in the analysis. \n",
    "Then, complete the second code cell to print out the first trip recorded from each of the cities (the second line of each data file).\n"

Normally, at this point in the data analysis process, you might want to draw conclusions about the data by performing a statistical test or fitting the data to a model for making predictions. There are also a lot of potential analyses that could be performed on the data which are not possible with only the data provided. For example, detailed location data has not been investigated. Where are the most commonly used docks? What are the most common routes? As another example, weather has potential to have a large impact on daily ridership. How much is ridership impacted when there is rain or snow? Are subscribers or customers affected more by changes in weather?\n",
